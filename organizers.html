The vision is to create holistic “Ideal Villages” where the basic needs of the community in water, healthcare, education, energy, livelihood, sanitation, etc. are fulfilled by applying innovations in science and technology and enabling integrated sustainable rural development. The kick-off S4S conference was held in June 2015 in San Diego, California. Annual S4S conferences are planned to build on the initial success and focus on collectively identifying and developing affordable, holistic solutions and products that can enable the Ideal Village concept to be scaled and deployed on a global basis. Such solutions have the potential to transform millions of lives in underserved regions across the globe. The efforts will rely on public-private partnerships to promote innovation and implementation.</p>

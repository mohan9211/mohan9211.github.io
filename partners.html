                    <p >With a mission to give back to India, USA and to global communities by providing technological solutions to issues related with water, health, energy, education, livelihood, and sustainability, a not for profit organization was formed to distinguish from the mission of PAN IIT Alumni Foundation, giving rise to WHEELS Global Foundation (WGF). In 2013, WGF was founded as an independent 501c3 to provide innovative technology driven solutions to the challenges that affect the global rural population in six areas; <strong>Water, Healthcare, Energy, Education, Livelihood and Sustainability</strong>. The organization partners with other national and international NGO’s and non-profit organizations, working in collaboration to provide assistance to a larger rural population globally. Our goal is to increase access, communication, and funding for technologies and/or charitable missions aimed at improving the living conditions of citizens across the globe through the implementation of sustainable programs.

                    <p >The Annual Ideal Village Conferences at Stanford have created a matrix for collaboration, networking and sharing of rural development experiences, knowledge, and project learnings between these organizations. The webinar series hosted by WGF has served as forum for thought leadership, best practices, key takeaways and practical outcomes in rural development. The 1st Ideal Village conference at Stanford University was focused on <strong>“Innovations for the Ideal Village”</strong>, and themes in subsequent years included: <strong>“Collaborations for the Ideal Village” (2017), “Empowerment of Women in Rural/Underserved Communities” (2018),  “Corporate Social Responsibility” (2019) and  "Sustainability and the Pandemic: Ensuring Human and Environmental Wellbeing."

                    <p >Science for Society (S4S) is a collaborative forum bringing together the right experts and professionals to discuss needs, challenges, and innovative solutions that can improve the quality of life of under-served communities. The vision is to create holistic <strong>“Ideal Villages”</strong> where the basic needs of the community in water, healthcare, education, energy, livelihood, sanitation, etc. are fulfilled by applying innovations in science and technology and enabling integrated sustainable rural development. The kick-off S4S conference was held in June 2015 in San Diego, California. Annual S4S conferences are planned to build on the initial success and focus on collectively identifying and developing affordable, holistic solutions and products that can enable the Ideal Village concept to be scaled and deployed on a global basis. Such solutions have the potential to transform millions of lives in underserved regions across the globe. The efforts will rely on public-private partnerships to promote innovation and implementation.</p><a href="https://www.scienceforsociety.com">https://www.scienceforsociety.com</a><br><br>
